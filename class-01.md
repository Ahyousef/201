### HTML

#### Process and Design

When creating a website, a designer have to take certain tings into consideration, such as: Who is the target audience? What is the motivation and goal of the visiter? How to attract the attention?

One method that helps put the designer in the mind of the visitor is by creating imaginary people, from different backgrounds and occupations, and imagine what they would want to see or how they would react.

Some **concepts** that help organize and ease up the process of creating the website are :

##### *SiteMap*

A site map is organizing the pages of the website, and deciding which pages go into which and where.

##### *WireFrame*

A wireframe can be considered as a sketch that the designer does before starting to fill the website, this represents a visual of the skeleton of the website and how it would look like.

##### Visual hierachy

Not all information have the same importance, some text needs to be seen before the other, and some images are not necessary. This is where visual hierachy comes in place, it is to prioritize and organize the website in a way to ensure you get the result that you want and expect.

Visual hierachy can be achieved through various ways, here are some of them:

- Color
    Use different color for the more important word
- Style
    Use a different ***Style*** for a highligh.
- Size
    Use a different font size.

##### Grouping

You can also group similar elements together, for exampe: payment methods should be in a group, Login and register should be in a group.

#### HTML5

Elements in HTML act as containers, and they help us indentify what the purpose of this part of the code is gonna be, and also help us oragnize the HTML code.

HTML5 has introduced new elements that act in place of `<div>` where you can still use it but it better to use the specefic element for the specefic purpose.

```
<article>
<section>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
```

Older browsers might not support the new elements in HTML5, in order to overcome that these elements should be defined as block elements in the CSS, and incase that is unsupported, then javascript HTML need to be used.

## Ducket Javacsript

### Introduction

Javascript is the third element for creating a webpage, since HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, Javascript is like the muscles that is more interactive. Javascript is able to react to the user and interact with the other elements. For example it can take away a value from the user, execute some function on it then manipulate and edit the text in HTML r the style in CSS.

### Expressions & Operators

Javascript has expressions similar to math, it uses the operators like =,+,- in both its strings and its numbers. For example you can add two strings together, or multiply some numbers together. JS also has something called **variables** wich are like empty boxes that you can assign data to and call/use them later on. 

### Functions

Functions are a set of statments, they are used specially when you need a certain set of statments to be run multiple times, so instead of writing the whole block of coding again, you just call the function. It also can contain parameters if you need them to be used within the fucnction.
