## Ducket HTML

### Chapter 4 "Links"

You might need to link between different websites, or even pages on the same website, to do that one uses the tag `<a>` which allows the user to click on the content of it and be redirected to a link.

One can also use links to send an email to a certain email address, this can be done using the same tag but with `mailto:` inside the href and then followed by the email address.

**Target** also can make the link open in a new tab, and by default should have the value `_blank`.

**Anchors** are used to move between differnt parts on the same page, this can be done by going to the #id for example.

### Chapter 15 "Layout"

CSS treats every HTML as its own box, and block-level elements are ones that appear on new lines, while inline elements are on the same line.

One can also position the boxes to be static, relative, absolute.

### Chapter 3: "Functions, methods and objects"

Functions help us not have to repeat a series of statments, since you can store them once and call them whenever you need to. Also functions can have parameters that you can also specfiy when calling the fucntion, as well as being able to return certian values.

Variables can be either local or global, global variables exist outside functions and can be called any where, local variables exist within a function and can only be called within that function.
