### Chart.js API

Sometimes we would use charts in order to present our data, this can be done using a helpful JS plugin called Chart.js which uses the canvas elements in HTML5 in order to draw the charts, first you need to install it in the directory of the project then import it into the page using the tag `<script>` like you would do with JS.

You can also draw using the same plugin, where you can do basic shapes like circles, lines and rectangles, but you can also use them for full drawings like a smiley face.

It also has many many options for styling the content, you can use colors for shapes and colors for outlines, shapes for the lines and endings too, there is also a way to use gradiants and transparency.

You can also draw text in it, in many ways and shapes and strokes, as well as the lines that set the top of the letters and the bottom of them.
