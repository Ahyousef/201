## Ducket HTML & CSS

### Chapter 15 "Layout"

CSS treats every HTML as its own box, and block-level elements are ones that appear on new lines, while inline elements are on the same line.One can also position the boxes to be static, relative, absolute.

The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. 

CSS has different wireframes, and they are there to serve different purposes depending on the websie and its function, and the targeted devices as well.
