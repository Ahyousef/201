## EJS Partials

Think of EJS Partials as functions for JS or classes for CSS, when you have something that you want to repeat or use multiple times, then you don't wanna write it over and over again.

Partials help making this possible in HTML, where if you want a section like a header be the same for multiple pages, you only write it once and then apply it to as many pages as you want.
