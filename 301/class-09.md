## Refactoring

Refactoring in JS is similar to use SMACC in CSS where instead of having one big code, we reorganize it into having multiple files and sections which makes the code more clean.

Some commands and concepts we can use is to export a module and require it in another files, this way we can use the module's methods and the exported constructors.

This both helps with readability and funcitonality as things that aren't required don't run unless its necessary.
