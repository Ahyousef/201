## SQL

SQL is a language that allows technical and non-techincal users to edit and manipulate databases and tables with ease. This can also be implemented in node js using things like mysql and postgresql. We will use postgresql.

Queries are like commands in english language that allows that manipulation, things like SELECT and INSERT.
