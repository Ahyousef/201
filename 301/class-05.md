Heroku is a cloud hosting service that supports multiple languages, it gives a free quota monthly that allows user to deploy their apps to the WWW meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the world like github pages live, but with proper backend support.

Heroku needs to be downloaded to your device first, after that you would need to set it up, then you can just deploy apps from the dahshboard online. Also you can run nodes and close them off using `heroku ps:scale`
