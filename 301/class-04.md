## Regex

Regex is a beautiful way of caputuring strings, I have used this in notepadd ++ where I would google how to search for all word starting with x letters and coppy the expression, but now I am able to do it myself which is amazing, its useful and proves to be the fastest way.

Like flexbox- grids have elevated our css layout experience, as it is one of the most powerful modules introduced to CSS, as it solves many problems we used to use display and float properties before to solve. Grid garden helped visualize the properties and their values which was very heplful as well.
