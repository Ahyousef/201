## Review

1. Array.map() creates a new array with the same length as the mother-array, and does a certain function on each item.
2. Array.reduce() saves time and effort by accumulating data from each item and return one item at the end.
3. ``` const superagent = require('superagent')  superagent.get(url).then((results) => console.log(results))```
4. ``` async function test(){ let results = await superagent.get(url)}```
5. Promises are tasks that take more than the usual instant tasks, which is why other things are run and it is executed later, basically they need results that take time.
6. All callbacks by default are asynchronous unless programmed otherwise.


## Preview

1. I have previously heard about:
    - NodeJS, now I know that we consider it single-threaded
    - NPM, now I know its basically like an app store for modules
    - Difference between javascript (programming language) and NodeJS (server environment)

2. I want to learn more:
    - Make desktop applications
    - Use frameworks
    - Industry tools

3. React
