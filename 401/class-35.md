# Graphs

## What are they

They are a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes(vertexes) and edges(connections);

## Directed vs non-Directed

The difference is with the edges, either they are directed like a vector, or they have no direction like a scalar.

## Weighted

Some graphs can be wighted, meaning their edges can have a certain 'weight' to go from one node to the other.
